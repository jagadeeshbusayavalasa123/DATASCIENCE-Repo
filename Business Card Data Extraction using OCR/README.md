## What is EasyOCR?

   EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from **business cards.**
   
   When it comes to OCR, EasyOCR is by far the most straightforward way to apply Optical Character Recognition:

   - The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.
   - The dependencies on the EasyOCR package are minimal, making it easy to configure your OCR development environment.
   - Once EasyOCR is installed, only one import statement is required to import the package into your project.
   - From there, all you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.

## Project Overview


Problem Statement: 

Problem have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
This project  requires skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. 

Functionalities Implemented:







1. HOME PAGE: 

   In this section, user could see overview of application under description and can find number business   
    cards already extracted and uploaded into SQL Datawarehouse. 
        -DEMO VIDEO: users can see a demo video for understanding all functionalities implemented in application.

2. EXTRACTION & UPLOADING:

    Here, user can browse "Business card"  and upload it.OCR processes the image & extracts information like NAME, MOBILE NUMBER, CITY, COMPANY NAME, AREA etc.....

    AFTER, extraction user can upload data into "SQL  DATAWARE" , using upload button.

 3. MODIFY:

     In this section, users can update details into sql db &can delete records even.


Results:

The result of the project is  Streamlit application that allows users to upload
an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name,
designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a
database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able
to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides
users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its
information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized
manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a
button.
 The result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals
who need to manage business card information efficiently.
